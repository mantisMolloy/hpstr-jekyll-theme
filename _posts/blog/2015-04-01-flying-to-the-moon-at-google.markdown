excerpt: I went along to the 3D camp at google HQ in Dublin to find out about some exciting Irish start-ups working in the VR space. Being somewhat of a VR novice I wasn't sure what to expect. What I came away with was a memorable experience and a free google cardboard.

# 3D Camp at Google

Yesterday I visited google HQ in Dublin to attend 3D Camp. Present were three entrepreneurs speaking about their companies all vying for space in the VR education market. At the end there was a demo and a chance to meet the speakers. I got myself a free google cardboard and learned lots of valuable information.

## Immersive VR Education

**Name:** David Whelan 

**Company:** Immersive VR Education

David opened up proceedings with a presentation on his company Immersive VR Education. David spoke about how VR applications can revolutionise education. His flagship product is Apollo 11 which was the subject of a successful kickstarter campaign. David also offered pearls of wisdom about running a kickstarter campaign and how a large car manufacturer is paying to have a small toy version of their car in Apollo 11 all thanks to the kickstarter campaign.

> It's very hard for a company in Ireland to get noticed in the VR space unless you use something like a kickstarter campaign

It was clear from David’s presentation that the Apollo 11 project is gathering traction and it seems that this project is coming to fruition just at the right time. With the launch of the oculus rift and other VR offerings from Samsung, Sony, and Microsoft on the horizon the Apollo 11 experience will be an early must have app for any of these devices. During his presentation David alluded to gaining attention from some big industry names and it comes as no surprise as Apollo 11 is one of the best oculus rift experiences on the market today. Watch this space for a full length Apollo 11 experience along with other exciting Immersive VR Education projects currently in development.

Immersive VR Education are currently hiring and anybody interested is encourage to get in contact.

## Mission V / SimVirtua
**Name:** James Corbett

**Company:** Mission V / SimVirtua

**website:** <a href="http://simvirtua.com/">simvirtua.com</a>

James is the co-founder of Mission V and SimVirtua. James spoke passionately about his projects using VR to help school children learn and collaborate. He has worked on projects in partnership with UCD, DCU, and NUI Maynooth and 11 primary schools across Ireland. 

His presentation highlighted the potential for VR in education. It was great to see school children build a replica of Clonmacnoise and then explore it in VR. Furthermore seeing children learning the scratch programming language by programming snails in a VR world was hugely impressive.

Again this is another company with great potential poised on the cusp of a huge rise in VR applications. If it wasn't for the dissolvement of the NCTE this technology could have already cemented itself into the education system in Ireland. Certainly it is a question of when not if VR becomes mainstream in the school system.

James also spoke about how SimVirtua has more projects in the pipeline. I'll be watching closely to see what emerges from their development team.

## unimersiv

**Company:** unimersiv

**Website:** <a class="clearfix" href="http://unimersiv.com/">unimersiv</a>

Baptist flew in from France for the 3D Camp. His project is a web hosting service for developers who want to promote and sell their products for VR devices. From his presentation and from chatting to him personally you can tell that he is passionate about VR applications, just what you'd want from someone offering a service like this.

The layout of his site is slick and with a competitive pricing strategy this is another company coming onto the market just at the right time. 

## Afters

After the presentations there was a chance to get some hands on experience with with some of the VR applications and chat to the presenters. By far the highlight for me was getting a hands on with the Apollo 11 experience. Sitting in the cabin of the rocket you feel like you can reach out and touch the controls. As you rise into space you can almost feel yourself become lighter as you escape earth’s gravitational pull and objects begin to float by you. This is certainly one experience I will be doing again. Or if I ever find the time maybe I try my hand with the cardboard SDK and see what I can come up with.

But it seems the speakers were trying to teach the audience by repetition as each one of the speakers had this quote in their presentation. All joking aside this quote sums up the VR education experience perfectly.
